# JADM - Just Another Display Mirror script to easily mirror displays on KDE Plasma
Made because i got a JetKVM for my desktop but didnt want it on a separate screen but ALSO wanted to be able to change what screen it mirrored. threw this together in less than an hour so be nice
should respect display configurations well enough.

1. download and create the jdam executable
`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoeWithTheE/JADM/master/jadm -o ~/.local/bin/jadm`

2. make it executable
`chmod +x ~/.local/bin/jadm`

3. save it to your bash profile so you can run it without specifying path
`(grep -q 'HOME/.local/bin' ~/.bash_profile || echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile)`

4. reload the terminal's bash profile
`source ~/.bash_profile`





i wonder how ebenezer scrooge / a christmas carol but as a musical and written as a comedy would be...
